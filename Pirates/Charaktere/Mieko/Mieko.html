            <p class="Introduction">Embers D. Mieko more commonly known as just Miko and by her epithet “Devilish
              Musician”, is a pirate and musician from West Blue and cook and first commander of the Heart Pirates. She
              is
              one of the thirteen pirates who are referred to as the “Worst Generation”. Her singing is well known among
              pirates. She is the daughter of Red-Haired Shanks and was a musician in his crew, until he left her while
              she was still a child. She travels alongside the Heart Pirates and supporting Law to find the One Piece,
              while also researching about the Will of D.
              <br><br>
              Before joining the Heart Pirates, she travelled a while as a musician. Through a series of unlucky events,
              she tried to protect someone she shouldn’t and faced Sakazuki, who left the battlefield, after Mieko was
              unconscious and badly injured at her back. She has a large burn scar on her back since then.
              <br><br>
              It was Ace, who discovered her and brought her to Whitebeard, who let her rest and get healed by Marco.
              She
              stayed with them for half a year, learned more about her Devil Fruit and more about the pirate life.
              During
              that time, she also received her first bounty 30.000.000. She was the first and only daughter to
              Whitebeard,
              as well as the little sister to everyone. Whitebeard, Ace, and Mieko agreed on leaving Miko behind on the
              next island, as it will be safer for her. They promised to meet again.
              <br><br>
              After helping the Straw-Hat Pirates on said island, they agreed on taking her with them to the next
              island.
              She became good friends with everyone and especially with Nico Robin, who is like her “older sister”. It’s
              been some time, until they separate again and just a few months later, she protected Law and Bepo and
              that’s
              how she ended up with the Heart Pirates
              <br><br>
              During the timeskip, her bounty increased from 130,000,000 to 300,000,000 and the name “Devilish Musician”
              became a name known in the new world, as she was able to easily take down Very Good and some lower-ranking
              marines.
              <br><br>
              She recieved her first bounty, as mentioned, as she was part of Whitebeards crew. The first raise was as
              the marine saw her in a battle with the straw hats and got to know her devil fruit. Her bounty was
              130,000,000. After the Events in the Summit War of Marineford and during the timeskip, her bounty was
              raised to 300,000,000. After the Dressrosa Arc, her bounty got another raise to 450,000,000. Eventually,
              her bounty would be raised to 1,540,000,000 for her role in taking down Big Mom of the Four Emperors.
              After the Marine told the world who she is, after the first incident that somebody saw her Emperors-Haki,
              her
              bounty was raised to 2,270,000,000.

            <p>tba</p>

            <h2><a name="Physical Abilities">Physical Abilities</a></h2>
            <p>In addition to her Devil Fruit, Mieko picked up some physical combat knowledge. Being together with the
              Whitebeard Pirates further trained this knowledge and she got quite skilled in a hand-to-hand combat. <br>
              Additionally, she has the physical power to block Attacks with her sword, which she can easily wield with
              great speed, and can strike fast. <br>
              She has enough physical strength to properly protect herself in a defensive stance with her arms crossed
              and don’t get blown from her feet instantly. <br>
            </p>

            <h3><a name="Durability and Endurance">Durability and Endurance</a></h3>
            <p>Mieko has displayed average level of physical endurance, as she can take some hits, as seen in the battle
              of Marinefort. Her recovery, however, is very fast. Losing consciousness due to her ability, she is
              quickly to recover shorty afterwards and able to walk again.
              Mieko can take several blows back-to-back and is able to still stand tall. <br>
              Her stamina, however, is severely damaged from her singing. She can sing one, sometimes two songs with
              using magic, before it’s really hard for her to use her abilities, especially if she tries to fight
              someone.<br>
              In the ongoing of the story, she is able to take hits better and has more stamina due to her hard training
              during the timeskip.
            </p>

            <h2><a name="Tactical Skills">Tactical Skills</a></h2>
            <p>Mieko is a very creative and opportunistic person, and also a rather skilled strategist. She has a great
              sense of keeping track of everyone on a battlefield, as shown at Marienefort, where she was able to get a
              quick overview and kept track of the position of everyone.<br>
              She is not scared to have multi-layered plans and always has a secret plan b. Her plans make it easy for
              her to trick people. <br>
              Even if her plans get exposed, she can instantly formulate a backup plan, taking advantage of the strength
              of the people around her. <br>
              Mieko quickly understands the strengths and weaknesses of her comrades or the people which are affected by
              the plan
            </p>

            <h2><a name="Devil Fruit">Devil Fruit</a></h2>
            <p>Mieko ate the Kyoka Kyoka no mi, a Peramecia-type Devil Fruit which allows her to manipulate tunes and
              give them a physical form. She can manifest these tunes with her own voice, with the voice of other people
              or with nearby noises and move the created objects however she wants, even weak barriers. Furthermore,
              Mieko has to concentrate in order to maintain and use the tunes, and unlike most Devil Fruit powers,
              Mieko’s powers directly take a toll on her stamina.<br>
              With the tunes, Mieko can attack, protect, or manipulate people. She can attack with the tunes with either
              a light or a dark energy. She can move objects with the tunes telekinetically and even carry herself with
              the tunes. However, she can’t move people with strong Haki, as they possess more resistance to Mieko’s
              power. <br>
              She can also imitate tunes or voices from other people. The more she’s heard from that person, the more
              she can speak with their voice. She can repeat sentences she’s from the first time she’s heard it. <br>
              This power can also be used for entertaining purposes; Mieko can sing and create non harmful colourful
              lights. <br>
              Mieko has achieved Devil Fruit awakening, allowing her to create pure dark or pure light energy. She can
              use her voice to fully take control over this energy via singing. The dark energy especially can be very
              dangerous and can cause damage to people and objects. The biggest weakness of this fruit can be seen even
              more, as the pure energy takes a serious toll on her stamina. Mieko also stated that she has not fully
              mastered her awakened powers and using them makes the musica voice inside her head very loud.<br>
